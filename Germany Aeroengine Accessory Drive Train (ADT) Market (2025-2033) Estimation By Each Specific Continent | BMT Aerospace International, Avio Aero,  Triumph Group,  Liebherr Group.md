<strong>According to a recently published analytical study titled ""Global Aeroengine Accessory Drive Train (ADT) Market Industry Analysis, Comprehensive Forecast, and Opportunities Assessment (2025–2033),"" the report provides an in-depth evaluation of market trends, growth opportunities, and projections.</strong>

Accessory drive train (ADT) is an aircraft engine equipment used in the transmission system. It is not a part of engine's core, yet it drives important accessories, such as fuel pump, hydraulic pump, oil pump, and generator, of an aircraft. ADT performs primarily two functions: First, during startup, it transmits torque from starter to engine core for it to come in motion; and second, to transfer the mechanical energy of the engine turbine to drive the accessories of the aircraft. ADT comprises four main components: accessory gearbox (AGB), internal gearbox (IGB), external gearbox (EGB) and radial shaft. AGB acts as the heart of an ADT.
